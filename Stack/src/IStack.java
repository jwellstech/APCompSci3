/*
A data structure is a container for strong related items
undr a single name.

Different data structures have different rules for things such as
item access, insertion, and removal

Places you might see stacks:
     HTML:  For an open tag, push the tag onto the tag stack
     for a close tag, peek at the tag stack.  If the close tag matches
     the tage onthe top, pop.  Otherwise abort and report error.
     If the tag stack is empty at the end, the documetn is well-formed.

     Call Stack:  when a function is called, a stack frame is created and pushed
     onto teh call stack.  when the function returns, its frame is popped.

     Check paren balance.
         read an expression
         push each ( onto the stack
         pop the top when you see a ).
         If you attempt to pop from an emoty stack, expression is unbalanced
         if there are leftover (s at the end, expression is unbalanced.
